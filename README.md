/ The justifications for drug testing are \
| part of the presently fashionable       |
| debate concerning restoring America's   |
| "competitiveness." Drugs, it has been   |
| revealed, are responsible for rampant   |
| absenteeism, reduced output, and poor   |
| quality work. But is drug testing in    |
| fact rationally related to the          |
| resurrection of competitiveness? Will   |
| charging the atmosphere of the          |
| workplace with the fear of excretory    |
| betrayal honestly spur productivity?    |
| Much noise has been made about          |
| rehabilitating the worker using drugs,  |
| but to date the vast majority of        |
| programs end with the simple firing or  |
| the not hiring of the abuser. This      |
| practice may exacerbate, not alleviate, |
| the nation's productivity problem. If   |
| economic rehabilitation is the ultimate |
| goal of drug testing, then criteria     |
| abandoning the rehabilitation of the    |
| drug-using worker is the purest of      |
| hypocrisy and the worst of              |
| rationalization.                        |
